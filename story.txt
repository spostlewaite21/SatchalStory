There once was a boy named John. He lived in the back of a barn. One night, we woke with a fright to find that all of his chickens were gone. "But where have my chickens gone" John cried with dismay. He cannot believe what had happened on this horrible day. All of a sudden, he heard a single cluck from outside.

There at John's feet was a chicken in its cool new ride. The chicken opened the passenger door, kicking around some garbage that was all over the floor. John hopped in the seat, behind him was the rest of the fleet. A chicken in the back, trying not to be whack, hollered "Buckle up, John."

The fleet drove John to a fancy castle. "This is the castle we built for you" said the chicken. John went into the castle, it's a fabulus castle with a lot of treasures and jewels inside.
